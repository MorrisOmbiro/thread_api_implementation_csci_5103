To run the tests in our program.
From the parent directory *(the one with the source directory and test_cases directory)
1. Run the make command 
2. copy the generated binary termed: uthread.a into test_cases directory 
3. cd into test_cases directory
4. execute any test as: g++ test1.cpp uthread.a
5. This generates an a.out file  which could then be used for execution
6. Run: ./a.out <num_of_threads>
